## 1. Data Cleansing Steps
### Convert the week_date to a DATE format
```
To_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy') as date
```
### Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
```
Extract('week' From To_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy')) as week
```
### Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
```
Extract('month' From To_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy')) as month
```
### Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
```
Extract('year' From To_date(week_date, 'dd/mm/yy')) as year
```
### Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
```
Case 
  	When Right(segment,1) = '1' Then 'Young Adults'
  	When Right(segment,1) = '2' Then 'Middle Aged'
  	When Right(segment,1) in ('3','4') Then 'Retired'
  	Else 'unknown'
  	End as age_band,
```
### Add a new demographic column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values:
```
Case
  	When Left(segment,1) = 'C' Then 'Couples'
  	When Left(segment,1) = 'F' Then 'Families'
  	Else 'unknown'
  	End as demographic,
```
### Generate a new avg_transaction column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
```
Round(sales :: Numeric /transactions :: Numeric ,2)
  as avg_transaction
```

### All the query and the result 
```
SET search_path = data_mart;

## Before and After analysis
This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.

Taking the `week_date` value of `2020-06-15` as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all `week_date` values for `2020-06-15` as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before
