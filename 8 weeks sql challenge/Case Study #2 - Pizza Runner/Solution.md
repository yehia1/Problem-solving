## D. Pricing and Ratings
This problems is like the previous problems but got more concern about the income and profit
### If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?
```
with pizza_price as(
Select c.order_id,
	Case 
    	When pizza_id = 1 then 12
        When pizza_id = 2 then 10
        End as price
    From cleaned_customer c
    Inner Join cleaned_runner r
    On c.order_id = r.order_id
	Where distance Is Not null)

Select concat(Sum(price), '$') As Total_money_earned
From pizza_price
```
| total_money_earned |
| ------------------ |
| 138$               |
### What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras? 
- Add cheese is $1 extra
```
with extras as(
  SELECT Count(extras) as extras From
 	(Select
	Unnest(string_to_array(extras,',')) as extras
    From cleaned_customer c
    Inner Join cleaned_runner r

## Bonus Question
If Danny wants to expand his range of pizzas - how would this impact the existing data design? Write an INSERT statement to demonstrate what would happen if a new Supreme pizza with all the toppings was added to the Pizza Runner menu?
```
INSERT INTO
  pizza_names ("pizza_id", "pizza_name")
VALUES
  (3, 'Supreme');
INSERT INTO
	pizza_recipes ("pizza_id", "toppings")
VALUES
  (3, '1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12');
  
Select * From pizza_names
```
| pizza_id | pizza_name | toppings                              |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10               |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12                    |
| 3        | Supreme    | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 |
